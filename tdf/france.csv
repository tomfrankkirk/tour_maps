Calvados,https://www.strava.com/activities/5940451237,"Set off with Elena, Dean and Ioana from the ferry. Stopping for two breakfasts and a broken spoke slowed us down massively so I split at 90k to try and get a bit further on. Nearly caught in a huge thunderstorm."
Le Mans,https://www.strava.com/activities/5940465566,"Trying to make up yesterday’s lack of distance, this was an absolute slog. Windy, humid, wet and sunny all at the same time."
Tours & Loire Valley,https://www.strava.com/activities/6192540596,Met Rupert in Savonnières just in time for yet another storm. Easy ride back to his through the Chinon forest (with many snacks and drinks).
Vienne,https://www.strava.com/activities/5950642040,"Riding with Rupert along the Vienne river. Unfortunately the original camp spot (by a waterfall) was blocked off, but we found another place alongside the river anyway"
Limousin,https://www.strava.com/activities/5950647227,"Riding solo again. Made a 20km detour to meet Scott for lunch, then pressed on into the Limousin. The hills are starting…"
Périgord,https://www.strava.com/activities/5963211106,Lumpy and hot. Big thunderstorm forecast in the evening so camped out under a bandstand to give the tent a rest!
Dordogne,https://www.strava.com/activities/5963214682,"Supposed to be an easy drop into wine country for a rest day, but thanks to an incredibly meandering cycle path turned out much longer than expected! Still very humid, the storm needs to break!"
Les Landes de Gascogne,https://www.strava.com/activities/5975914017,"Flat and fast day out to the coast, with yet more headwind. Started out grey but cleared up for an amazing sunset. Slept on a picnic table in the pines."
Côte Landais,https://www.strava.com/activities/5975937249,Easy half day out to the beach at Moliets. Through the french outback?
Pays Basque,https://www.strava.com/activities/5987205098,Atoning for the revelry of the night before. Relentlessly wet until the last hour. Slightly improved by the local cakes and seeing kiwi groves
Lourdes,https://www.strava.com/activities/5987211598,Shorter day and mercifully dry. Climbing up to Lourdes for a mechanical pit stop in preparation for the real climbs. Managed to catch the depart of a local race in Nay!
Pre Tourmalet,https://www.strava.com/activities/6007689799,"Finally underway again after a very frustrating 4 days of mechanical problems in Lourdes. Too late in the day to go up Tourmalet, so it’s first up tomorrow"
"Col de Tourmalet, Hourquette d'Ancizan & Lac de Cap de Long",https://www.strava.com/activities/6024480015,"A Very Long Day. Took in an incredible gravel backroad that joins the Tourmalet to the Hourquette (or Aspin). The final climb up to the lake was brutal, much harder than Tourmalet. Camped out next to a refuge due to terrible forecast."
"Lac d'Aubert, Col d'Azet, Col de Peyresourde & Porte de Bales",https://www.strava.com/activities/6024489150,"Phenomenal descents all day long, particularly Azet, which was very sinewy. Paced up the final two climbs by none other than an ex French Ironman champion, which was much appreciated. Porte de Bales was tough. Stopped for the night in an open refuge which turned into an unexpected party!"
Col de Mente & Portet d'Aspet,https://www.strava.com/activities/6024617856,"A very sore head from the night before. Climbing up Mente in the blazing sun was effective for sweating it out. Mercifully short day and mainly downhill as I’m now heading out of the mountains for a rest day. Strangely, the two lowest altitude climbs I’ve done here are probably the two steepest."
Haute-Garrone,https://www.strava.com/activities/6029089452,"Meant to be an easy transition day, but instead was battling the tramontane wind. Also featuring some engineering nerd indulgences."
Gaillac,https://www.strava.com/activities/6036565530,Time for a rest day
La Montagne Noire,https://www.strava.com/activities/6043901863,Relatively short day as I wanted to make the end point in time for a swim. Final climb up to the lake was very tough - 10km of farm track and forest road with sections at 20%
Haut Languedoc,https://www.strava.com/activities/6048964998,"Crazy day. Started with the pic nore, the local version of ventoux, though the perhaps the view is even better. I could even see the Tourmalet, over 200km away. My route builder chose a terrible way off this, a full on mountain bike track that got proper gnarly man, and then turned into a ski slope, and then turned into nothing at all. I had to walk about 5km downhill which took a very long time. Followed an old railway line up the valley (cool tunnels), then climbed up onto the plateau. The descent off col fontfroide was spectacular - long, fast and sweeping. Ended the day with a climb up the Héric gorges to see the almost-abandoned village, which was very eerie, and then headed back down to watch a tight game of pétanque."
L'Hérault,https://www.strava.com/activities/6059154375,"Hot, lumpy and windy (behind me for once). It being market day meant the bakeries had sold out of pretty much everything, but the local dancing was on show instead. Then climbed up a valley to visit the least used train station in France with 200 passengers/year (the line itself is a heroic piece of engineering). Towards the end of the day the wind really started to pick up (an ‘episode cevenol’ aka massive storm was forecast). Stopped off to visit the fortified village of St Jean d’Aclas and was promptly invited to have dinner and stay the night to sit out the storm. So, I write this to you from a priests lodgings dating from 1200!"
L'Averyon,https://www.strava.com/activities/6058796126,"Stormy, wet and windy. Waited for a lull to sprint over into the next valley. Descending switchbacks in hail was grim. The silver lining of a heavy bike however is it can handle a huge crosswind with ease!"
Les Grandes Causses,https://www.strava.com/activities/6068356049,"Phone died a death in the morning so I went on a wild goose chase to find a repair shop. Magically, it started working again in the afternoon (without any repair). Will it make it through the rest of the trip???"
Cévennes,https://www.strava.com/activities/6068350195,"Wet, cold and windy. Mont Aigoual was not in a good mood today. Pushed the pace to try and stay warm."
Lozère,https://www.strava.com/activities/6079160822,"Most satisfying ride ever? Day started off bright and very cold as I tracked up the stunning gorges du Tarn. Then climbed up mont Lozère (col finiels, fabulous road and very consistent gradients). There was a bitterly cold headwind up on the plateau that was against me for the remainder of the day. The exposure up there is severe. Just when I was starting to get properly hacked off with it all the end point came into site - an unmanned mountain refuge. There’s a fireplace, bunk bed and armchair, and I’ve got the place all to myself. Never been happier to finish a ride!"
Ardeche,https://www.strava.com/activities/6079198331,"I’m tired of being cold all the time, so I decided to chase the sun today. Said goodbye to the Massif Central and followed the Ardèche out. Still a surprisingly lumpy ride (and a huge crosswind didn’t help), but I am at least a lot warmer now!"
Ventoux,https://www.strava.com/activities/6085128689,"Conditions couldn’t have been better - perfect temperature and not much wind. Ventoux was long overdue for me! The second descent from Sault (Liguiere) was exceptional, especially during the lavender scented sunset."
Luberon,https://www.strava.com/activities/6088207615,What a seductive place to ride ones bike. Time for a rest day. 
Verdon,https://www.strava.com/activities/6103754273,"Onwards and upwards to bigger things. A scorching hot day riding through Haut Provence, the air was thick with the smell of pine resin and thyme. Stopped for a swim in lac Sainte Marie before climbing up through the Verdon gorges."
"Cols de St Barnabé, Buis, Félines",https://www.strava.com/activities/6103808551,Easing into the big stuff. Another beautiful day. Met a very fat and happy cat.
Cols de Valberg & Couillole,https://www.strava.com/activities/6108352578,"Relatively short day, getting into position for tomorrow. A long and technical descent off Couillole, pretty tiring stuff."
Cime de la Bonette & Col de Vars,https://www.strava.com/activities/6113148861,"The highest road in France, and high point of my tour (artists impression). Freezing to start with (literally), scorching by the end of the day. The last 4km of Vars really sneak up on you. KOM attempt on Bonette aborted due to sheep herding"
"Cols de Izoard, Lautaret, Galibier",https://www.strava.com/activities/6123041644,"The queen stage of my tour. Izoard was new to me, as was the Lautaret and Galibier from Briancon. Day started cold but heated up fast, and so the Lautaret turned into an all out slog: the sun was beating, the wind was blowing down the valley and the road was busy and exposed. It was getting late by the time I made it up the Galibier and the light was spectacular. One final surprise in store: the north face had a fair amount of snow and ice hiding in the shade, so it was a slow and careful descent. Stayed in Valloire with Jean Louis and Ghislaine, who stuffed me full of Provençal cuisine and then sent me straight off to bed! I was spent."
Cols de Télégraphe & Madeleine,https://www.strava.com/activities/6134448506,"Trying to take it easy after the monster of the day before but the Madeleine had other ideas. I crawled up. Nevertheless, my day was brightened immensely by trying out a tandem on the Télégraphe - they were going up the Galibier!"
Cols de Tamié & Marais,https://www.strava.com/activities/6134464858,"DELIVERANCE! Riding into Annecy after this week’s trials was a victory lap. Also, it being a Sunday, met tons of local club riders. Thus ends my alpine crossing: 7 days, 740km, 16k climbing, and the grandest of grand cols. It’s been epic. Tomorrow is off, so see y’all on Tuesday."
Genève & Jura (francaise),https://www.strava.com/activities/6143008280,Geneva… what a strange strange place! Beautiful lumpy ride through the Jura mountains with the leaves just starting to fall. Witnessed a collision on the Franco / Swiss border; it was eventful but luckily no harm done. Ran out of daylight for a swim in lake Neuchatel.
Jura (suisse),https://www.strava.com/activities/6144254916,"Windy day, not the best. Was riding just to get there. The terrain is pretty frustrating after the consistency of the alps. Here, the climb is never over when you think it is! Cleared up for a nice evening however, and tomorrow I’m taking a day off in Basel. Auf wiedersehen!"
Schwarzwald & Alsace,https://www.strava.com/activities/6166024955,"What a day! Breakfast in Basel, a very chilly climb in the Black Forest (with an incredible hybrid Franco German pastry on the border) and an evening spin through the mines and vines of Alsace. Definitely worth a visit (EuroVelo 5 passes through here)"
"Grand Ballon, Col de Hundsruck, Ballon d'Alsace",https://www.strava.com/activities/6166085488,"The realisation of a long held desire to ride in the Vosges, and it was fantastic. It being a Saturday, had loads of company across the climbs. Lunch was a ‘bretzel garni’, a big pretzel with bacon and emmental. Stayed in a cross country ski chalet, it was supremely cosy."
Petite Finlande & Haute-Saône,https://www.strava.com/activities/6170461432,"Mammoth day cutting across from the Vosges to Burgundy. Scenic route via the plateau of 1000 ponds, aka little Finland. First time riding on properly flat roads in about a month - makes a difference! So easy to eat up the miles out here."
Côte-d'Or,https://www.strava.com/activities/6192471075,A pilgrimage back to the place where I have always ridden my bike since being very young. Riding in during the closing stages of my tour was a profound experience.
Haute-Marne,https://www.strava.com/activities/6192407860,"Relatively gentle day. Had a McBaguette, though I can’t really recommend it. Stayed in a wonderful little forest hut, though the people who built it had maybe taken the whole fairy tale dwarves aspect of it too far, the ceiling was seriously low in there."
Aube,https://www.strava.com/activities/6187410879,"Another beautiful morning with pockets of mist lingering in every valley until midday. Visited the grave of Charles de Gaulle (decent amount of tourist traffic), passed through the wonderful forest and lakes of Orient, and finished up in Troyes, a wonderful little city. For the first time ever, I had two coffees at lunch and seemed to get a second third and fourth wind all at the same time. I was riding like a man possessed through the second half of this (relatively speaking, it’s hard to make a touring bike move fast!)"
Champagne,https://www.strava.com/activities/6187369321,"My phone was dead so no pictures. Shame, as the towns round here have some major bling to show off: lots of gold plated statues and lettering etc. Did a big chunk along the Marne canal, not quite the easy cop out I was hoping for (the towpath is in terrible condition and I might as well have been riding single track)"
Paris,https://www.strava.com/activities/6187338892,"A suitably grim finale to the adventure. Wet and windy from the off pretty much, which was appropriately bleak given the battlefields and army cemeteries I was riding through. As I reached Paris there was a wonderful rainbow over the city, which I am taking to be a sign from the weather gods to pack up and go home. Stay tuned for an epilogue on Monday."
