Starting with a bang,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410287738,First day of our US tour. Caught in a biblical thunderstorm within 20 minutes of leaving Eugene. Then took the scenic gravel route through the hills to the south and finished up with a 20km TTT to the campsite at Elkton in the driving rain.
The day of a thousand punctures,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410286466,"Armen punctured 8 times. Hit the coast at Reedsport for an all-American lunch in a diner, met the boss of Californias number 1 rated thrift shop at North Bend (everyone else was packing) and did her a good turn. After sorting Armen's tyre troubles made it to the campsite at dusk in time for a bottle shower."
"Devils in the morning, hell in the evening",https://www.strava.com/activities/2410283760,"Started with Seven Devils road. Quiet, and beautiful, but tough going. Footlong subs all round in Bandon for lunch, and then into the most demoralising piece of riding imaginable: 50 straight km into a block headwind gusting 50mph. We were naive in stopping for a breather in Port Orford; the storm front swept in and the last 10km was in driving hail. By the time we made camp at Mt Humbug everything was sodden."
Into California,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410283792,"The day started calm and overcast. The riding down the coast was spectacular, Arizona beach in particular. We made the border with California in mid-afternoon and decided to push for another 25km to a campsite in the Redwoods. Unfortunately as soon as were over Armen ran over deliberately placed tacks, puncturing twice, so we were caught out in yet another storm. The silver lining was that we arrived at the camp in such a state that Christian and Rain, the rangers, took pity on us and sorted us out with unlimited showers, beer and a fire."
"Trees, trees, bonkers",https://www.strava.com/activities/2410283898,"The day started sunny, which was a huge relief considering at this point we were in kit that had been soaked not once but twice. Riding through the park was splendid: mighty redwoods as far as the eye could see (and blocking out almost all the sky). The evening was cold and we made camp just as I was starting to seriously bonk."
Motorway miles,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410283961,"The wind was finally in our favour so we pushed hard to make up lost ground from the earlier days (due to the terrible weather). This was the perfect day to do it: a good 100km on dual-carriageway sections of the 101, so there wasn't exactly much in the way of scenery to miss out on. The final 50km was along Avenue of the Giants was perfection as we had the whole thing to ourselves. The campsite turned out to be closed so we found a convenient bush opposite a fabulous hotel to pitch up our tent and then blagged our way in for a hot shower (and complimentary sherry!?)"
Micro-climates,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410284106,"Started HOT. Left the 101 at Legett to join the 1 and head back out to the cost via 2 tasty hills. As soon as we crested the first one we entered a completely different (and now-familiar) weather system: cold, dark and wet. Once back on the coast, Westport delighted us with the worlds most expensive sandwich, as did Fort Bragg with the world's best calorie/$ ratio: $8 for the 2000-cal all-American Super Sub (one was enough for both of us!) Camp was at Russian Gulch, the first time in California we actually paid for a site, and luckily so as the rangers were round to check first thing next morning."
Lumpy,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410284264,Less than 200 miles to go. Beautiful coastline - a bit like Brittany or Wales - and very lumpy which made for a slower going. The wind was very much in our favour however.
Celebratory oysters,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410284283,Tomales bay is prime oyster country so we picked up a dozen to enjoy at our evening camp with a celebratory bottle of wine. Using an Allen key to open them at the camp certainly got us a lot of attention from the other cyclists sharing the site with us (at last - the first fellow cyclists we'd seen)
Finish line,https://www.strava.com/activities/2410284315,A real sting in the tail on the way in - some steep and nasty climbs just before the Golden Gate to really make you earn the view. Aside from that it was a nice sunny day to be in SF!
